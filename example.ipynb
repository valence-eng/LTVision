    "**pLTV opportunity size** refers to the potential additional revenue generated by building a pLTV model and activating a pLTV strategy, compared to the business’ existing customer acquisition strategy, to help business decision makers evaluate the potential ROI before investing in a pLTV model and strategy. <br>\n",

    "## How can pLTV initiatives drive additional revenue?\n",
    "- **A pLTV model:** Customers are not created equal, and their revenue contribution to a business’ long-term success varies. Therefore, a pLTV model is needed to help businesses accurately identify high-value customers that are crucial to a business’ long-term success.\n",
    "- **A pLTV strategy:** Digital customer acquisition campaigns are bound by attribution windows (e.g. the attribution window Meta uses is 7 days), and only a portion of revenue/purchase events happen within 7 days after ad exposure, which means businesses are missing out on opportunities to acquire high-value customers outside the 7-day attribution window. Therefore, a pLTV strategy is needed to help businesses acquire high-value customers by optimizing towards high-value pLTV signals. \n",

    "- Increase signal value: by replacing ALL signal segments (‘no spender’, ‘low spender’ and ‘medium spender’ signals) with ‘high-spender’ signals in the best case scenario\n",

    "1. User-level pLTV model relies on user identifiction, when identification relies on 1st Purchase, the pLTV model is to unable to improve the day-7 ‘no spender’ signals with higher-value signals simply because pLTV predictions were not available\n",
    "2. Compared to CEO, where advertisers can accurately define ‘high-value customers’ using a value threshold (e.g. pLTV > $100), a Bid Multiplier strategy can reduce bids on low-value customers and increase bids on high-value customers effectively, however, there's no clean cut to ensure the strategy will ONLY acquire the highest value new customers. \n",

    "## Are all customers worth the same? <br>\n",
    "**Purchase Frequency:**\n",
    "- 4.4% of all customers are revenue-generating customers or purchasers\n",
    "- 39% of all purchasers have purchased only once <br> \n",
    "- 29% purchased twice\n",
    "- 14% purchased three times\n",

    "**Top spenders' contribution to total revenue:**\n",
    "- The top 5% highest spending customers contributed to 69% of total revenue\n",
    "- The top 10% contributed to 75% of total revenue\n",
    "- The top 20% contributed to more than 84% of total revenue\n",

    "## Can your digital customer acquisition campaigns capture all new purchasers? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time to First Purchase:**\n",
    "- 55% of first-time purchases happened within 7 days of the initial interaction\n",
    "- Since the remaining 45% of first purchases happen beyond the 7-day optimization window, it means that the current digital customer acquisition campaign is missing out on 45% of the purchases that happen outside the 7-day optimization window\n",

    "**Correlation between short-term and long-term revenue:**\n",
    "- There is high correlation in early time frames. For example, the correlation between day-7 revenue and day-10 revenue is a robust 95%\n",
    "- However, as time progresses, the correlation between day-7 revenue and future revenue weakens significantly. By day-22, this correlation has already dropped below 40%. This suggests that day-7 revenue is not a reliable indicator for revenue on day-22 and beyond.\n",
    "- This diminishing correlation between early and later revenue is a crucial indicator of the potential value a pLTV strategy could bring to a business.\n",

    "**Purchaser Flow Overtime:**\n",
    "- 27% of no spenders by day-7 became high spenders by day-60 \n",
    "- 29% of low spenders by day-7 became high spenders by day-60 \n",
    "- 23% of medium spenders by day-7 became high spenders by day-60 \n",
    "- In total, 66% of high spenders by day-60 were not high spenders at day-7\n",
